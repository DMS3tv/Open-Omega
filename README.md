Open omega is my attempt at making a passive dynamic headphone that closely adhere's to the DF-HRTF of the B&K 4128C with a 10db downward slope from 20hz-20khz.
The headphone was originally designed to be made via SLS. I've simplified elements of the design and assembly, making it easier to build at home.

I want to add that Capra is working on a 3D printable headband for the omega design. Here's his links: https://capraaudio.com/ https://www.printables.com/@CapraAudio
