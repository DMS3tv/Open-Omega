Open omega is my attempt at making a passive dynamic headphone that closely adhere's to the DF-HRTF of the B&K 4128C with a 10db downward slope from 20hz-20khz.
The headphone was originally designed to be made via SLS. I've simplified elements of the design and assembly, making it easier to build at home.
Video instructions on how to build the headphone will be available soon on my youtube channel. www.youtube.com/dms3tv
